# Humano

## Summary

**Humano** is an app that helps users prepare for an encounter with ICE or law enforcement and quickly informs a userâ€™s network if they worry they may be detained. Humano was designed for undocumented immigrants who are in fear of being detained or deported by law enforcement, however it could be a general platform for emergency notifications. A customized message along with the user's location is sent to their network at the click of a button using the Twilio and Google Maps API. Once a user has set up their account, Humano provides resources to help educate users about their legal rights,  search for lawyers in their area (using the Google Places and Google Details APIs), and get the most recent news regarding immigration (using the News API).
